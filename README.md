# 📝 Word Replacement Generator 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a simple **text-based word replacement generator** built in Python. The script reads a story from a text file (`story.txt`), identifies placeholders within angle brackets (`< >`), and asks the user to provide words to replace them. The final story is then displayed with the user's inputs.

## 🎮 How It Works
1. The script **reads** a story from `story.txt`.
2. It **finds** all words inside `< >` (e.g., `<noun>`, `<verb>`).
3. The user is prompted to **enter a replacement** for each placeholder.
4. The **final modified story is displayed**.
